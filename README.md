### Finbert-LC: Finetuned BERT model on Real and Synthetic Generated Data for Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project involves fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model on both real and synthetically generated data to enhance financial sentiment analysis. This approach leverages pre-trained language models and aims to improve sentiment detection accuracy specifically within the financial domain.


### Features

•	Pre-trained BERT fine-tuning tailored for financial sentiment analysis.

•	Synthetic data generation to augment real data, enhancing model performance.

•	Sentiment classification (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) specific to finance-related text.

•	Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and robustness in real-world financial sentiment analysis.


### Data

The dataset includes both real financial data and synthetic data generated to represent possible real-world scenarios. Synthetic data aims to address domain-specific challenges, such as limited training data in financial sentiment contexts.
