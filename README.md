### Finbert-LC: Finetuned BERT model on Real and Synthetic Generated Data for Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project involves fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model on both real and synthetically generated data to enhance financial sentiment analysis. This approach leverages pre-trained language models and aims to improve sentiment detection accuracy specifically within the financial domain.
